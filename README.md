# MiniVario-Arduino
Acoustic Mini Variometer with Bluetooth function. 
There are 2 modes for this mini Varion:
  - Acoustic Vario is a standard when switched on.
  - And as a Bluetooth Vario. In order to start in this mode, simply press and hold the button and then switch on the Vario. As soon as you hear the start tone, release the button and couple the Vario. That was it.
